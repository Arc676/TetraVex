# TetraVex
A TetraVex port for Mac.

Intention
---------

My goal is to clone - kind of - the TetraVex game for the Windows 3.1 OS, now 
for macOS using **only** the Cocoa API - this includes the view drawing, no
external graphic files. I don't know if the original game used only the Win16 API
but still this seems like a fun thing to do.

Target
------

This project is written in Swift 3, so the app. target is macOS 10.12.

Contribute
----------
